# centroid based clusterting #https://uc-r.github.io/kmeans_clustering
# kmeans() arguments
# k stands for the number of clusters, k can be manually determined, or the best amount of clusters for the data computed
# kmeans(x, centers, iter.max = 10, nstart = 1)
# x: numeric matrix, numeric data frame or a numeric vector
# centers: Possible values are the number of clusters (k) or a set of initial (distinct) cluster centers. If a number, a random set of (distinct) rows in x is chosen as the initial centers.
# iter.max: The maximum number of iterations allowed. Default value is 10.
# nstart: The number of random starting partitions when centers is a number. Trying nstart > 1 is often recommended. 
#However!: As the final result of k-means clustering result is sensitive to the random starting assignments, we specify nstart = 25 (recommended e.g. https://uc-r.github.io/kmeans_clustering). 
#This means that R will try 25 different random starting assignments and then select the best results corresponding to the one with the lowest within cluster variation. 
#The default value of nstart in R is one. But, itâ€™s strongly recommended to compute k-means clustering with a large value of nstart such as 25 or 50, in order to have a more stable result.
